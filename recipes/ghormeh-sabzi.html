        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A classic, popular Persian recipe, Ghormeh Sabzi is originally an vegetable and meat stew, served alongside Basmati rice. This stew is considered a national symbol of Iranian cuisine, and was dearly beloved throughout all my childhood of having vegan dinners with my family.</p>
        <P>While this stew classically has meat, it can be easily left out, and its ingredients of mostly herbs, lime, and beans are enough to fill you up regardless.</P>
        <p>Without further ado, here's how you can make this celebrated stew at home!</p>
