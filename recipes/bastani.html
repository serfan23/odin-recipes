        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In my family, this sweet, rosewater and saffron flavored dessert has been a long-standing favorite any time we take trips to Iran. However, finding a vegan alternative proved difficult in both Iran and America, which is where this recipe comes handy!</p>
        <p>Note: you will need an ice-cream maker for this recipe. To find saffron and rosewater, places like Whole Foods Market and Middle Eastern markets have them available.</p>
        <p>Here's how you can make this ice cream plant-based at home!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups Silk Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened soy milk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup cane sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of saffron and rosewater</li>
            <li>1/3 - 1/2 cup chopped pistachios</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>A day before you make your ice cream, place a bowl for churning the ice cream to chill in the freezer beforehand.</li>
            <li>Blend Silk heavy cream, soy milk, and sugar for 30 seconds. Add mixture, alongside saffron, vanilla, and roeswater, to a bowl and whisk together.</li>
            <li>Add mixture to pre-chilled bowl and churn until appearance of soft-serve, or based on your ice-cream maker's instructions. (EX: Cuisinart is 20-25 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Add chopped pistachios in the last portion of churning (1-2 minutes).</li>
            <li>Freeze for 2 hours. You can keep this mixture in the freezer for up to 5 days.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
